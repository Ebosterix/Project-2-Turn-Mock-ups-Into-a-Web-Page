# Project-2-Turn-Mock-ups-Into-a-Web-Page
My challenge is to build, from scratch, a website for Reservia, a small company offering a vacation planning tool. Their site allows users to find accommodations and activities in the city of their choice. Accommodations can also be filtered by theme, for example, their budget or their atmosphere. The purpose is to ntegrate the responsive mock-up in HTML and CSS.
